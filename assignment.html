	<h1>99 Bottles of Beer</h1>

	<p>"99 Bottles of Beer" is a traditional song for long car trips, since it
	has a format understandable by children, and can take a long time to sing.
	The song's lyrics are:</p>

	<blockquote>
		99 bottles of beer on the wall!<br/>
		99 bottles of beer!<br/>
		Take one down<br/>
		And pass it around<br/>
		98 bottles of beer on the wall!<br/><br/>
		98 bottles of beer on the wall!<br/>
		98 bottles of beer!<br/>
		Take one down<br/>
		And pass it around<br/>
		97 bottles of beer on the wall!<br/><br/>
		â‹®<br/><br/>
		1 bottle of beer on the wall!<br/>
		1 bottle of beer!<br/>
		Take one down<br/>
		And pass it around<br/>
		No more bottles of beer on the wall!
	</blockquote>

	<p>The same verse is repeated, each time with fewer bottles, until the singer
	reaches zero.  Note how the last two verses will read "1 bottle" and not "1
	bottles", and "No more bottles" instead of "0 bottles".</p>

	<p>Write a program that prints out all the verses to "99 Bottles of Beer".
	Make sure that the output of the program matches the format shown above.</p>

	<p>The source file of the program should be <code>bottles.cpp</code>, and be placed
	in your <code>submit</code> directory.</p>
